# SimpleLogistics
Simple MVC project using EntityFrameworkCore and RazorPages.

# Details
This project started as a training project, to learn the basics about EntityFrameworkCore and MVC projects. It simply creates a few tables and operate on some of them. A few basic initial data is inserted at the first migration update.

# How To Use:
Steps to make the project running locally will be inserted here in a while.

# TODO

A few things that are intended to be implemented to improve the project:

- Check Views structure and correct relations between tables for maintaining integrity and visualization purposes;
- Correct the relations and validate fields shown in views;
- Create a app that will benefit from the already existing structure;

# Considerations
Any help, tips, suggestions are greatly appreciated since they will probably help me a lot to improve the project and my programming skills along with it. Fell free to leave a comment if you think it could help the project anyhow. Thanks!
