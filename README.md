# SimpleLogistics
Simple MVC project using EntityFrameworkCore and RazorPages.

# Details
This project is a training project, to learn the basics about EntityFrameworkCore and MVC projects. It simply creates a few tables and operate on some of them. A few basic initial data is inserted at the first migration update.
Intended to have an interface that will manipulate the system and not just the views related to specific tables from the app, like an ERP application.

# How To Use:
Steps to make the project running locally will be inserted here in a while, since the whole process is still been learned.

# TODO

A few things that are intended to be implemented to improve the project:

- Check Views structure and correct relations between tables for maintaining integrity and visualization purposes;
- Create Views that will replace the ones used to manipulate data directly on tables, based on user clearance;
- Create and use some set permissions for users, with different clearance leves for each;
- Correct the relations and validate fields shown in views;
- Create a app that will benefit from the already existing structure;
- Only show data manipulation links to users with the correct clearance level;
- Implement a dockerfile to run the project as a container.

# Considerations
Any help, tips and suggestions are greatly appreciated since they will probably help me a lot to improve the project and my programming skills along with it. Fell free to leave a comment if you think it could help the project somehow. Thanks!
